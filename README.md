The code uses various data preprocessing techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the given dataset and visualize it in a 3D scatter plot. It also applies Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce dimensionality to 3 and visualize the dataset.

Firstly, the necessary libraries are imported and the dataset is loaded from an Excel file using Pandas. The 'id' column is dropped from the dataset and the target variable ('B.C.') is separated from the feature variables.

Then, the numeric columns are scaled to have a z-score of 0 and the covariance matrix for the z-scored data is computed. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is then performed to reduce the dimensionality of the data to 3 components, and a new dataframe with the principal components and the target variable is created. Finally, a 3D scatter plot is created to visualize the data.

Next, the mean of the z-scored data is computed and the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix are calculated. The explained variance ratio of the PCA is then printed.

A pipeline is created to scale the data and perform PCA. Outliers from the dataset are detected and removed using a z-score threshold of 2.5.

Finally, LDA is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset to 3 and visualize the dataset in a 3D scatter plot. The explained variance ratio and total percent variance are printed.
